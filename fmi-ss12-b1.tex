\begin{exercise}
  Consider the problem \textbf{PROCEDURE NEG-ASSIGNMENT}, which is defined
  as follows:

  \begin{center}
    \fbox{
      \begin{minipage}[c]{.9\linewidth}
        \textbf{PROCEDURE NEG-ASSIGNMENT}

        \medskip INSTANCE: A triple $(\Pi,I, k)$, where (i) $\Pi$ is a
        program that takes one string as input and outputs true or false, (ii) $I$ is a
        string, and (iii) $k$ is an integer variable used in program $\Pi$.     \\
        QUESTION: Does variable $k$ ever get assigned a negative value when the program $\Pi$ is executed with input $I$?

        
      \end{minipage}
    }
  \end{center}
  Prove that \textbf{NEG-ASSIGNMENT} is undecidable. Prove the undecidability
  by providing a reduction from the \textbf{HALTING} problem to
  \textbf{NEG-ASSIGNMENT}, and arguing that your reduction is correct.
\end{exercise}


\solution

To prove the reduction, we have to show that 

\bigskip

$\Pi'$ halts on I $<==>(\Pi, I, k)$ is a positive instance of NEG-ASSIGNMENT.

\bigskip

Let $(\Pi', I') $ be an arbitrary instance of HALTING.  Set $I = I'$, let be k an arbitrary integer occuring in $\Pi$ and  construct $(\Pi, I, k) $ in the following way: 

\smallskip


\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]                % Start your code-block

bool $\Pi(I)$
{
   I = I';
   call $\Pi'(I')$;
   k = -1;
}

\end{lstlisting}

\bigskip


$"=>"$

\bigskip

Assume that ($\Pi', I'$ ) is a positive instance of halting, so $\Pi'$ halts on $I$ because we set $I = I'$. Directly after the termination of $\Pi'$, we set $k=-1$, so $(\Pi, I, k)$ is a positive instance of NEG-ASSIGNMENT. 

\bigskip

$"<="$

\bigskip

Assume that $(\Pi, I)$ is a positive instance of NEG-ASSIGNMENT, so it returns TRUE which means that k gets negative and the program terminates. But the only time when k gets set to a negative value is directly after the call of $(\Pi', I')$, where $I=I'$, so $\Pi$ halts on $I$, so $(\Pi', I')$ is a positive instance of HALTING. 

\bigskip

\begin{exercise}
  Prove that the problem \textbf{NEG-ASSIGNMENT} from Exercise 1 is semi-decidable. 
To this end, provide a semi-decision procedure and justify your solution. Additionally,  show that the co-problem of \textbf{NEG-ASSIGNMENT} is not semi-decidable.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
  Give a formal proof that \textbf{SUBSET SUM} is in $\NP$, i.e.\, define a
  certificate relation and discuss that it is polynomially balanced and
  polynomial-time decidable.
  
   \smallskip
    
  \noindent In the \textbf{SUBSET SUM} problem we are given a finite set of integer numbers $S=\{a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\}$ and an integer number $t$. We ask whether there is a subset $S'\subseteq S$ whose elements sum is equal to $t$?
  
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
  \label{ex:partition}
  Formally prove that \textbf{PARTITION} is $\NP$-complete. For this you may use
  the fact that \textbf{SUBSET SUM} is $\NP$-complete.   
  
  \smallskip
  \noindent In the \textbf{PARTITION} problem we are given a finite set of integers $S=\{a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\}$. We ask whether the set $S$ can be partitioned into two sets $S_1, S_2$ such that the sum of the numbers in $S1$ equals the sum of the numbers in $S_2$?

\begin{exercise}
  \label{ex:frequency}
  Formally prove that \textbf{FREQUENCY ASSIGNMENT} is $\NP$-complete. For this you may use
  the fact that a similar problem used in lectures is $\NP$-complete.
      
    \smallskip
        
  \noindent In the \textbf{FREQUENCY ASSIGNMENT} problem we are given a set of transmitters $T=\{t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_n\}$,  $k$ frequencies, and the list of pairs of transmitters that interfer and therefore cannot use the same frequency. We ask whether there is an assignment of each transmitter to one of $k$ frequencies such that there is no interference between the transmitters.

\begin{exercise}
  \label{ex:CO-NP}
  Fomally prove that logical entailment is $co-\NP$-complete. The formal definition of entailment ( $\models$) is this: $\alpha \models \beta$ if and only if, in every truth assignment in which $\alpha$ is true, $\beta$ is also true.  
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
  \label{ex:Colors}
  It is well known that the \textbf{k-COLORABILITY} problem is $\NP$-complete for every $k \geq 3$. Recall that the instance of \textbf{k-COLORABILITY} is an undirected graph $G = (V, E)$. Suppose that we restrict this instance of \textbf{k-COLORABILITY} to trees. Can the restricted problem be solved with an algorithm that runs in polynomial time? If yes, provide such an algorithm. 
\end{exercise}


\solution

By definition, a tree MUST NOT contain any cycles. By modifying DEPTH or BREADTH FIRST SEARCH, we get an algorithm for k-colorability that works in polynominally time. Consider a tree with n - nodes, where every parent-node has x child nodes. One extreme example would be a tree where every node has exactly 1 child. The other extreme would be a tree with 1 parentnode and n-1 childnodes, directly attached to the parent.

Our algorithm has to process every level of the tree, starting at the root-node, coloring the node with one out of k colors. Afterwards, the next level has to be processed. If we take again the extreme with only 2 levels(1 parent, n-1 childs), we have to color (n-1) nodes and the program has finished. Otherwise, if every node has one child, only 1 node has to be colored with another color. This step then must be repeated n times.

Normaly, an average tree will be a mixture of the 2 extremes. This means that we have at most $n$ levels, with $(n-1)$ nodes at each level, which means that the algorithm is $O(n^2)$.  

\begin{mylisting}
\begin{verbatim}

for( every level of the tree )
{
   for( every node in this level )
   {
      color(node, color);
   }
   increment color(color);
}

\end{verbatim}
\end{mylisting}

\begin{exercise}
  \label{ex:Nqueens}
  Provide a reduction of \textbf{N-Queens} problem to \textbf{SAT}. Give a proof sketch of the correctness of your reduction. Does this implies that the \textbf{N-Queens} is an $\NP$-complete problem? Argue your answer.  
  
  \smallskip 
  
\noindent In the \textbf{N-Queens} problem we are given $n$ queens and an $n \times n$ chessboard. We ask whether we can place these $n$ queens on the  chessboard such that no two queens attack each other. Two queens attack each other if they are placed in the same row, or in the same column, or in the same diagonal.
